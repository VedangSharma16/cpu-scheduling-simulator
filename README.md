# CPU Scheduling Simulator (C)

A terminal-based CPU Scheduling Simulator implemented in C.

## Features
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
- Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
- Round Robin Scheduling
- Calculates:
  - Completion Time (CT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Average WT and TAT

## Technologies Used
- C Programming
- GCC Compiler (MinGW)
- VS Code

## How to Run

Compile:
gcc cpu_scheduler.c -o cpu

Run:
./cpu

## Concepts Applied
- Process Scheduling Algorithms
- Structs
- Arrays
- Sorting
- Time Complexity Logic
